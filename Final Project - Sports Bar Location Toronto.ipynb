The location of a sports bar is one of the biggest determinants if it will get enough traffic to pay all of its expenses and eventually turn a profit. Sports bars have become much more popular over the last handful of years and finding a location that still has plenty of demand can be tricky.\n\nOur objective is to recommend the best locations in Toronto to open a new sports bar."

In a city, we will assume you can drive about 8 km (or 5 miles) in 14 minutes. Using the Foursquare API we will determine how many sports bars are within a 5 mile radius of each postal code. We will then use these numbers to determine the number of sports bars per 5 mile radius there are for each postal code.\n\nWe will generate a table with rows corresponding to neighborhood, and columns with\n- postal code\n- longitude\n- lattitude\n- population\n- sports bars in 5 mile radius\n- sports bars per capita\n\nThe neighborhood with the least amount of sports bars per capita should be the ones with the most potential demand for a new sports bar."
